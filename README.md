# Cryptography

# File Encryption Desktop Application
Desktop application with friendly and easy interfaces that allow users to add his/her sensitive files. Users will be given certain options to encrypt and decrypt their sensitive files in the local device with an encryption key. This adds a new feature to the application.Application will be able torun on more than one operating system like (Windows, Mac, and Linux). User will be asked to choose the file that will need to beencrypted. When all the required fields are done, the application will encrypt the files.The FEDP application will use AES, RAS, and Checksum symmetric algorithms for secured and good performance where they will ensure that the application will do the given instructions and specifications at best possible manner.

# Objectives
To minimize the risk of hacked and compromisedfile.
To build and design File encryption desktop application with easy and friendly interface.
Toprovide powerful security and reliability in File encryption application.
To encrypt more than a small amount of files and any type of files.

# Application Features
Allow more than one encryption key.
Allowto encrypt file or folder.
Allow to create new keyssecurelyand safely.
Allow to export and import the keys in a secure manner.
Runon operating systems(Windows, Mac, Linux).

# Features of the algorithms used
Validates encrypted files and folders using hashvalue.
The file size will not change after encryption and decryption.
Secured that many international companies use it.
High speed encryption and decryption.


The desktop application will enhance the encryption and decryption process and minimizethe risk ofunauthorized accessto userâ€™s files. However, the application will provide additionallevel of security when encryption and decryption files and folders and allow to share multiple files as well as protect them from being hacked or compromised. Moreover, FEDP application will set strictan authentication factor where a user must be verified in order to encrypt and decrypt files or folder. In addition to that, application will be built with smooth and friendly interface to be easy to navigate and interact more easily and efficiently.
